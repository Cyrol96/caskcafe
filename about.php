            <p class="lead text-dark">
                Caskcafe is Nigeria’s pioneer and number one healthy food chain, providing fresh, delicious, nutrient-rich
                healthy meals and committed to promoting a healthy lifestyle.

                Located in PolyGate, Ilorin, Kwara state, Colette’s opened in 2019 and currently employs 3 people. Owner
                Jamaldeen Abdulazeez grew up in the restaurant business as her family owned and operated the busy diner for
                34 years.

                While a lot has changed, some recipes are still used today. Opening at 10 am and running until 8:30 pm daily,
                Colette’s offers eat-in, take away, and delivery with online ordering coming soon. Jamaldeen, Nadia, and staff
                are so very grateful to all their loyal customers who have supported them for the past 2+ years, particularly as
                of late with a pandemic upon us. "We are truly humbled!".
