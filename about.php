<h2 class="text-bold">Our Story</h2>

<h3 class="text-white">Caskcafe is Nigeria’s pioneer and number one healthy food chain, providing fresh, delicious,
    nutrient-rich healthy meals and committed to promoting a healthy lifestyle. CASK CAFE IS BEST and that is how we win
    every day,
    selling a wide range of fresh salads, juices, smoothies, parfait, fiesta wraps, sandwich and other quick on the go
    healthy meals.
    At Caskcafe, we believe food should be fresh and close to nature as possible, because the choices we make about what
    we eat,
    where it comes from and how it’s prepared have a direct and powerful impact on the health and wellbeing of
    individuals,
    communities and the environment.

    Located in PolyGate, Ilorin, Kwara state, Colette’s opened in 2019 and currently employs 3 people. Owner Jamaldeen Abdulazeez
    grew up in the restaurant business as her family owned and operated the busy diner for 34 years. While a lot has
    changed, some recipes are still used today. Opening at 10 am and running until 8:30pm daily, Colette’s offers eat in,
    take away and delivery with online ordering coming soon. Jamaldeen, Nadia and staff are so very grateful to all
    their loyal customers who have supported them the past 2+ years, particularly as of late with a pandemic upon us.
    "We are truly humbled!".</h3>
